2003page is a open source website. People can contribute to 2003page freely. It was launched on May 4th, 2019.

You can contribute if you want, most of the subsites right now are bland retrosite-quality subsites that were made in 2019/early-2020.

To anyone wondering, this is the same 2003page as the one that shutdown in May 2020, it was brought back 5 months later.
