For anyone wondering, this is a sandbox for testing Bootstrap 5, which once out of beta, will be used in all of the primary 2003page stuff.

Bootstrap 5 is still incomplete, thus, in order to interfere the daily 2003page (currently on a version of Bootstrap 4) shenanigans.

Shit'll break from time to time. Don't worry.
