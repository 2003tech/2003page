You probably are not expecting this autistic shit to start. But it is true, it has started.

In Jan 2020, former 2003page owner and MessengerGeek forum member XPuser made Retrosite, which has heavily bloated in size and is utterly fucking useless
compared to 2003page, TWTACCT and Blockpage.

When you Git Clone Retrosite, you give 1 gigabyte of your fellow hard drive storage to this bloated pile of shit.

They ignore your pull request because they are procrastinating with other useless shit, they are scum.

They give you the impression that 2003page shutdown because when you click the "2003page" button, It doesn't link you to 2003page. No no. It links you to 2003page
forever, which mentions that 2003page shutdown. Because guess what, It was last updated in May 2020, they're not going to update it because FUCK GAMERAPPA.

XPUser is a toxic fuckhead, he caused 99.99% of the drama happening in 2003page, which is utterly fucking autistic. We never needed this 2003site.gq bullshit.

In fact, why did we just ended up with 4 nearly identical projects, TWTACCT was a bit unexpected, Retrosite was utterly a middle finger, and Blockpage was
just fine because it was actually a new vision (that i can't implement) to 2003page.

I hope Retrosite dies.

No more Retrosite button on MY index anymore, fuck that button. but i'm 100% certain they're keeping the "DID U KNOW 2K3PAEG IS A DEAD" button on their index.
