2003page Readme
[LAST UPDATED 10/6/2020 BY CHAZ]

The folders you see here are the code and assets of so-called "subsites", sub-directories (actually sub-sub-directories) on 2003page that fell like they're their own website.

Some "subsites" no longer exist, as they were moved (ethier to Retrosite, or for the case of the PF94 subsite, spun off into it's own now-abandonned website). The archived zip files, available prior to the reopening of 2003page (10/5/2020) have been purged, along with other unused junk.

For the creation of your own subsite, contact Gamerappa on Discord or Escargot.

Try to be creative with your own subsite, and try not to be dependent on assets4every1, as that deprecated thing will be deleted in 2021. Post-October 2020 2003page is not what Pre-October 2020 2003page (not including Project Pheonix, that was more of a shitty frankenstein website recycling 2003page's index.html because of laziness, and yes, the PF94 subsite).

If you weren't born in the 90s, then why the heck do you nostalgize about website from the early-2000s? I don't get it, that's weird and stupid. Use something else other than Frontpage or a old version of Dreamweaver.
