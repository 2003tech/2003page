# Q&A

Q: How can I participate in 2003page

A: Ask Gamerappa#0162 on Discord, he will give you contributor permissions for the 2003page repository.

Q: Where should I put my large files?

A: We recommend that you put large files (this includes videos and executables) onto a external file hoster, GitHub repositories are recommended to be less than 5 GB in size, ideally 1 GB. We currently do not support Git LFS, however we might start supporting it in the near future.

Q: InfinityFreeHosting and 000webhost exists, why does this need to exist?

A: 2003page was created by me (and RetroSite creator XPuser) in May 4th 2019 as a expriemental project. While the free site hosting services aren't "static page hosting" (so they support stuff like PHP, we can't), compared 2003page, they are kinda controversal and scummy.

Q: Can I use Frontpage 2003 or a very old WYSIWYG website application?

A: Yes, but please try to use something else, We don't want to look too simillar to RetroSite.

Q: Wait, didn't this shutdown?

A: It did, from May 9th (i think) 2020 to October 4th 2020. The project was later revived (and reuploaded to GitHub, as it had been previously nuked) as a change of heart.

Q: This doesn't look 2003-y.

A: We moved from fake nostalgia, when I added gradients to the main page in March 2020, it got nicknamed "2007page" by a former contributor, when I modernized the main page later in October 2020, it got nicknamed "2015page" by said contributor. It should be noted that the older subsites look more 2003-y (well, more like late-90sy), because they were made in a different era of 2003page, before Retrosite existed.

Q: Gamerappa/Parappafan94? That name is famillar

A: Yes, I'm the guy who was trolled by a tech community in mid-2016, or the guy that made sparta remixes from 2015-2017. I'm trying to get rid of this legacy (the latter of which probably still exists, the other is forgotten cause it happended almost half a decade ago)

Q: I want to quit 2003page. Please delete my subsite.

A: An application exists called "chaz!zTech 2003page Subsite Purger", it was programmed by Gamerappa to ease the deletion of subsites. It's still in beta, but you can execute the batch file to get rid of your subsite. Do not use this to vandalize other people's subsites.
