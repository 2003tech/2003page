This is for the main page buttons, Compare this to the so-called pre-shutdown 2003page that PF94 keeps mentioning about


Pre-shutdown 2003page
* Buttons are more customizable
* Most of them are generated or hand-made, thus being inconsistent.
* Unoptimized
* Pain in the arse


Modernized 2003page
* Buttons are more restricited (bootstrap lmao)
* The icon is the user's profile picture, because the buttons look mostly the same, there's consistency.
* Optimized
* Simple.
