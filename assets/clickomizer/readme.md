WITH THE CLICKOMIZER YOU CAN CLICK THE "CLICK HERE" BUTTON ON THE MAIN PAGE AND GET ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED

## Actual Explanation

The clickomizer is an HTML file that redirects you to one of these files when the "Click Here" button in the mainpage is clicked. WARNING: Wha-Whu? It's all cringe?! What the fuck?!.
