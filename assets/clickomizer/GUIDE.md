# HOW TO ADD A THING TO THE CLICKOMIZER
Literally every contributor needs this. They dont understand how the fucking thing works and its actually pissing me off
## Step 0:
Submit your file to Upwader, and he'll see if it fits under the GitHub regulations.
```My discord is Upwader#2829 (CASE SENSITIVE)```
## Step 1:
Upload your file to assets/clickomizer
## Step 2:
Go to root/clickomizer.html and copypaste the last string of random urls WITH THE COMMA, then modify it to link to your submission.
```urls[33] = "https://2003page.upwader.com/assets/clickomizer/yunicuaEXE.mp3";```
## Step 3 (REALLY IMPORTANT):
MODIFY THE URL NUMBER. I CANT STRESS THIS ENOUGH
```urls[33] = "https://2003page.upwader.com/assets/clickomizer/yunicuaEXE.mp3";```
```urls[34] = "https://2003page.upwader.com/assets/clickomizer/yunicuaEXE.mp3";```
```urls[35] = "https://2003page.upwader.com/assets/clickomizer/yunicuaEXE.mp3";```
